GT Data and Analytics Bootcamp: Homework 2 - VBA Scripting


Encountered Difficulties in v1 of executing script due to lack of a progress indicator, as well as Excel seeming/appearing to "bog down/become unresponsive". This led to me canceling script run multiple times before it was able to finish.  Was able to add an indicator message box that advised when each worksheet was being started, which provided for a roughly 33% completion indicator. 

Attenpted multiple smaller batches to ensure that the script wasn't failing completely, and then finally was able to execute the VBA script against the entire file of ~2.2M records across 3 worksheets. Approximate runtime is as follows: 

Worksheet 1: 797K Records @ 00:06:48 approx (HH:MM:SS)

Worksheet 2: 760K Records @ 00:06:08 approx (HH:MM:SS) 

Worksheet 3: 705K Records @ 00:05:45 approx (HH:MM:SS) 

Total Runtime: 2.2 M Records @ 00:18:49 total (HH:MM:SS)
